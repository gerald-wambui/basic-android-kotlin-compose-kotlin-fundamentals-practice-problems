<h1>FizzBuzz</h1>
The _FizzBuzz_ problem is a classic programming exercise often used in coding interviews to assess a candidate's basic programming skills and logical thinking. It's a simple task that involves printing numbers from 1 to a given integer n, but with a twist:<br>

   * For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.<br>
   * For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.<br>
   * For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.<br>
   * For all other numbers, just print the number itself.

```kotlin 
fun fizzBuzz(n: Int) {
//code here

}
fun main() {
    val n = 100 // Change this to the desired range
    fizzBuzz(n)
}
```
